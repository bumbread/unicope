The unicode-based functions work based on official unicode data. You can find
the file with Unicode data at:

    https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt

This file is placed into this directory by the name data.txt. To update the
unicode standard a new file is put under that name, then unicode_compile.py is
ran with python interpreter. It will generate a new unicode.h header file.

DO NOT MODIFY data.h DIRECTLY BRUH.
